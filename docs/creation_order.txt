The Logic for the Order
The implementation order is based on the principle of dependency: a class or structure should be implemented before any other class that uses or depends on it.
Foundational Data Structures: These are used by almost every other component and have no dependencies themselves.
Core Interfaces & Parameter Classes: Define the contracts (interfaces) and specialized data structures that other classes will use. The base parameter class comes before the classes that extend it.
Base Noise Providers: These are the simplest providers. They depend only on the foundational structures and interfaces.
Fractal Noise Providers: These are more complex and are built on top of the Base Noise Providers, so they must be implemented after them.
Modifier/Combiner Providers: These are the most complex providers, as they take other providers (of any type) as input. They should be implemented after the components they might combine.
The Main Orchestrator: The MapGenerator class uses all the other components to build the final product, so it must be implemented last.
Implementation Order and Class List
Phase 1: Foundational Data Structures
These are the core building blocks with no dependencies on other custom classes in the system.
Vector2D (Struct/Class)
Purpose: A simple data structure to hold x and y coordinates.
Properties: x: float, y: float.
Reasoning: This is used as an input parameter for every single noise generation function.
Heightmap (Class)
Purpose: To store and manage the final 2D map data.
Properties: A 2D array of floats (e.g., float[][] data), width: int, height: int.
Reasoning: This is the ultimate output of the system, but its structure is simple and it's needed by the MapGenerator.
INoiseProvider (Interface or Abstract Base Class)
Purpose: To define the common contract for all noise-generating components. This is crucial for the modular architecture, allowing the MapGenerator to treat all providers polymorphically.
Method Signature (Conceptual): A generate(...) method. The exact signature will vary, so this might be a "marker" interface or a base with a flexible signature.
Phase 2: Parameter Structures and Enums
These are specialized data structures for configuring the noise providers. They should be created before the providers that use them.
NoiseParameters (Base Class/Struct)
Purpose: A base class for all noise parameter configurations.
Properties: seed: int, frequency: float, amplitude: float.
Reasoning: Must be created before the more specific parameter classes that inherit from it.
FbmParameters (Class/Struct)
Purpose: Specific parameters for Fractal Brownian Motion-based providers.
Inherits from: NoiseParameters.
Adds Properties: octaves: int, lacunarity: float, persistence: float.
ModulationParameters (Class/Struct)
Purpose: Parameters for the NoiseModulationProvider.
Inherits from: NoiseParameters.
Adds Properties: operation: enum (where the enum would contain values like ADD, MULTIPLY, AVERAGE, SCREEN). You'll need to define this enum as well.
MaskParameters (Class/Struct)
Purpose: Parameters for the HybridMaskProvider.
Inherits from: NoiseParameters.
Adds Properties: blendThreshold: float, blendSharpness: float.
Phase 3: Base Noise Providers
These providers generate fundamental patterns and depend only on Phase 1 & 2 components. They can be implemented in any order relative to each other.
ValueNoiseProvider
PerlinNoiseProvider
SimplexNoiseProvider
OpenSimplexNoiseProvider
WorleyNoiseProvider
All Implement: INoiseProvider interface.
All Use: Vector2D and NoiseParameters as inputs.
Phase 4: Fractal Noise Providers
These providers depend on the existence of a BaseNoiseProvider (from Phase 3) to use as a source.
FbmProvider (Fractional Brownian Motion)
BillowNoiseProvider
RidgedMultifractalProvider
HybridMultifractalProvider
All Implement: INoiseProvider interface.
All Use: Vector2D, FbmParameters, and an instance of a Base Noise Provider (e.g., PerlinNoiseProvider) as inputs.
Phase 5: Modifier & Combiner Providers
These are the most complex providers. They take other INoiseProvider instances (from Phase 3, 4, or 5) as input, so they must be built after those are available.
DomainWarpingProvider
Implements: INoiseProvider.
Depends on: INoiseProvider (takes two provider instances: baseProvider and warpProvider).
NoiseModulationProvider
Implements: INoiseProvider.
Depends on: INoiseProvider (takes two provider instances: providerA and providerB). Also uses ModulationParameters.
HybridMaskProvider
Implements: INoiseProvider.
Depends on: INoiseProvider (takes three provider instances: maskProvider, providerA, providerB). Also uses MaskParameters.
Phase 6: The Main Orchestrator
This is the final class that ties everything together. It depends on all previously defined classes.
MapGenerator
Purpose: The high-level class that reads a configuration, instantiates the required noise providers (from Phases 3, 4, and 5), and runs the generation pipeline.
Depends on: All INoiseProvider implementations, Heightmap, and all parameter structs.
Core Logic: Implements the generateMap method, which contains the pixel iteration loop, coordinate transformation, pipeline execution, and final normalization pass as described in the ICD.
